Once ready, we tell the world how to replicate them.\n\nOur approaches count on people to bring about the necessary change. We run a network of plastic recyclers around the world, which actively engages in transfer of know-how and techniques. We also run a community marketplace for machines, moulds, materials and products.",

This plan involves improving the entire range of what we have done and built before, and more.\n\nThe overall funding required for this is 2 million euros, split over three phases: Sustaining recycling(400K), Increasing recycling(700K) and Going beyond plastic(900K).\n\nWe will spend this money on people, machines, practices, generating impact data, and building a sustainable ecosystem that goes beyond recycling.\n\nSupport us to help unlock the full potential of v5!",
